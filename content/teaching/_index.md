This Engineering Core Course introduces students to mechanics, scalars and vectors, concurrent forces, statics of particles, moments and couples, force system resultants, rigid body equilibrium, frames and machines, internal forces, kinematics and kinetics of particles, conservation theorems, impulse-momentum, and centres of gravity.


|CIVE 3208 Geotechnical Mechanics                            |        Undergraduate|Carleton|
|:---                                                        |                ----:|   ---: |

The course will enable students to understand fundamentals of geotechnical engineering and associated soil properties and mechanics, including soil composition and classification, soil compaction, seepage and permeability, concepts of pore water pressure and hydraulic head, the principle of effective stress, stress-deformation and strength characteristics of soils, consolidation, stress distribution within soils, and settlement, as well as laboratory tests to determine soil properties and parameters.


|CIVE 4918 Design Project                                    |        Undergraduate|Carleton|
|:---                                                        |                ----:|   ---: |

This course provides 4th year CEE students with the opportunity to learn how to apply engineering design principles in a major group design project. While working on the projects, the students will learn how to effectively plan, schedule, search for data and information, communicate and co-operate in a team environment. Also, students will learn how to manage a project.


|CIVE 5800W Computational Geomechanics                       |             Graduate|Carleton|
|:---                                                        |                ----:|   ---: |

The course aims to provide graduate students knowledge and skills in advanced geomechanics, constitutive modelling and numerical analysis of geotechnical problems. It covers plasticity theory, soil constitutive modelling, finite element method, discrete element method, and other advanced topics.


|​CIVL 4750 Numerical Solutions to Geotechnical Problems      |        Undergraduate| HKUST  |
|:---                                                        |                ----:|   ---: |

The final-year undergraduate course aims to teach students the fundamental knowledge and skills using numerical methods (finite difference and finite element methods) to solve practical geotechnical problems. It offers hands-on experience in using commercially available software (GeoStudio, FLAC, PLAXIS) and helps students to establish key judgements on selection of models and parameters and verification of numerical results.
