Ning is __"100-talents Program" Professor__ at Zhejiang University (ZJU). Prior to his joining at ZJU, Ning was Assistant Professor at Carleton University in Canada and Lecturer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Ning obtained his bachelor's and doctorate degrees from Tsinghua University and HKUST, respectively. Ning's research interests mainly focus on fundamental soil mechanics and computational geomechanics. He is enthusiastic about applying advanced numerical methods in modeling geomaterials, such as the multiscale and meshless methods. He is the principal investigator of two NSFC (National Natural Science Foundation of China) grants. Ning is the two-time winner of the Scott Sloan best paper award in 2018 and 2021 for his papers published in Computers and Geotechnics. He is now a corresponding member of TC103 and TC105 of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering.
