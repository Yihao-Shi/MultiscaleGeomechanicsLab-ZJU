abstract: A shear‐transformation‐zone (STZ) model is proposed for time‐dependent behaviours of clay, in which the viscoplastic deformation is described by the evolution of a temperature‐like state variable. The model is featured by rate‐dependent dilatancy and a unique critical state stress ratio. In its present form, it has nine parameters, most of which can be handily calibrated, and can predict the rate‐dependent undrained shear strength, primary, and secondary creep, as well as stress relaxation for normally consolidated clay under complex stress paths using a single set of parameters. The capabilities of the model have been verified by available experimental results on five different clays.
