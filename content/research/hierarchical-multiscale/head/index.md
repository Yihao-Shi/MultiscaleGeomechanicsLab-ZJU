      title: Hierarchical multiscale modeling of granular media using coupled Finite Element and Discrete Element Method (FEM/DEM)
      text: The method has been integrated into the open-source DEM code YADE. Please see https://yade-dem.org/doc/FEMxDEM.html for more detail. The following examples show 1) compaction band formed in saturated high-porosity sandstone under globally undrained biaxial load and its transition to shear band due to effective stress decrease; 2) asymmetric settling of footing resting on inherently anisotropic sand; 3) shear failure of a thick-walled hollow cylinder in dry sand; 4) triaxial compression of sand.
